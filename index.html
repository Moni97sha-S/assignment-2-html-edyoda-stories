                        The process used by companies to convert raw data into useful information is called Data Mining.
                        It is a process of searching, collecting, filtering and analyzing the data. A large amount of
                        data can be retrieved from various websites and databases. It can be retrieved in the form of
                        data relationships, correlations, and patterns. With the advent of computers, the internet, and
                        large databases it is possible to collect large amounts of data. The data collected may be
                        analyzed steadily and help identify relationships and find solutions to existing problems.
                        Governments, private companies, large organizations, and all businesses are after a large volume
                        of data collection for the purposes of business and research development.

                        DevOps was developed for a more holistic approach to the end-to-end software delivery cycle. It

                            a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that
                            into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing
                            were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all
                            about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values.
                            Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample
                            input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, itâ€™s time to delve in a

                        <div class="text">The two biggest social platforms have created a buzz in the application
                            development industry.
                            React Native by Facebook and Flutter by Google are the latest two cross-platforms for mobile
                            application development technologies. The popularity of these frameworks has taken over the
                            much older framework in a very short span of time. However, both React Native and Flutter
                            are very popular among the developers who wish to create native applications for Android and
                            iOS without spending much time and effort. Therefore, we recommend to learn mobile

                        <div class="text">Wondering why Database Management Systems like MySQL, NOSQL, MSSQL, Oracle
                            SQL, MongoDB form
                            the fundamental blocks behind working with the data? Working with data would face severe
                            hindrances and would be next to impossible without a Database Management System(DBMS). Pick
                            any company, it can still live without Machine Learning, but It definitely needs a DB System
                            in place. Why? Very often when you play around with data, you have to be proficient in
                            performing tasks like Visualizing the real-time data, Fetching result based on user request.
                            Take an example, letâ€™s say if you are working in the domain of Digital Marketing, you might
                            be interested to know the 5 most popular keywords to optimize your campaigns. In such a
                            circumstance, you have to get back to your databases to find the solution to your problem.
